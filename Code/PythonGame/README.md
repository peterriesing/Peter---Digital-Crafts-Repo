# Python Game Project

Project Name: "Dumpster Hero"

## About the game
Dumpster Hero is a simple game where you play as a raccoon defending your home dumpster from an attacking dog named Scraggles. The object of the game is to kill Scraggles. Scraggles has more health than you so you'll have to fight him after eating trash. 

## Game Elements
Class - All of the data for character atributes(name,health,etc.), consumable items, and class functions like taking or inflicting damage are stored within the class.

Functions - Functions operate specific sequences for the game. There are two levels of functions in this game. Class functions mentioned above and global functions that operate the healing and gameplay.

Loops - Loops navigate the in game menus. If/elif loops navigate menus. While loops ensure that specific criteria are met to continue or cease functions.

## Project Summary
Overall this project taught me a lot. I learned how to implement the core concepts we learned into a functioning program. I learned how to begin the process for building a program. Before attempting this my thought was to build out all of the classes functions and then begin stiching them together with loops. This didn't work for me. I stepped back and started by making the MVP - a game that worked in its simplest form. From there I fleshed out details within the game. I also found it helpful to build larger functions and loops to navigate them in files other than the main game file. After proving those worked it was easier to implement them in my main file. 

I left out a bunch of ideas that would have made this a more interesting game. I could not figure out how to use dictionaries and lists within the class. This caused me to cut out a "choose character" function as well as a function that let you battle many different enemies of different types. I also cut "items" that could be used to add damage to attack values. With these things I understand the logic behind how they should work but I struggled with incorporating them and then had to cut them for time to deliver a functional game

One more thing I did when I felt the burnout of coding and getting nowhere was take a break and design a logo. I created a logo for Dumpster Hero in Adobe Illustrator. This gave me an alternate creative outlet to work on while taking a break from my code.

## Beyond the Project
This was not easy for me. I felt confident making functions and classes but when it came to integrating the class elements I struggled. As mentioned above, I was hoping to put more content into the game. I need to have a better understanding of how to use dictionaries and lists within classes. Toward the completion of the game I ran into issues getting my loops to function properly. To really understand python I'll have to continue building projects like this or algorithms.
