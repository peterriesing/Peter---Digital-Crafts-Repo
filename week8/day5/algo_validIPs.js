// given a string of 12 or less digits write a function that returns all possible IP addresses that can be made by inserting 3 '.'s, where each individual int is within the range 0-255, inclusive

// integers cant contain a leading '0' like '01' or '00' but can be a standalone '0'

// return the valid addresses in string format, no particular order

// maybe hashmap all possible numbers = {1,19,192,9,92,2,21,216,1,16,168,6,68,8,80,0}
